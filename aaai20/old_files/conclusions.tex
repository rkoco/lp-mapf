\section{Conclusions}
We proposed a compilation to ASP that produces cost-optimal solutions, which is competitive with other search-based algorithms on small grids.

Future research will be focused on finding alternatives to execute the \emph{grounding}. And exploiting even more the benefits of parallelism offered by the clasp solver.
