% Problem definition
% The \textit{Multi-Agent Path Finding} (MAPF) problem is defined by a graph $G = (V,E)$ and a set of $k$ agents $\{r_1 ... r_k \}$. Each agent $r_i$ has a start location $s_i \in V$ and a goal location $g_i \in V$. At each timestep the agents take an action that can \textit{move} them to an adjacent location or \textit{wait} in its current location. A \textit{path} for an agent $r_i$ is a sequence of actions that take $r_i$ from $s_i$ to $g_i$. The objective is to find a \textit{path} for each agent such that agents...

\emph{Multi-agent pathfinding (MAPF)} is the problem of finding $k$ conflict-free paths for a group of $k$ agents, each of which has the goal of reaching a goal state from a certain start location. Formally, given:


 Solving MAPF optimally for each one of the cost functions is intractable. Indeed, it is NP-complete when considering MAPF over 4-connected grids \cite{YuL13}.
